# Building-a-Neural-Network-Model-using-Keras
This code uses the income data set to predict whether a given data point has an income below or above $50k. This code also includes data visualization, Data preprocessing, and tuning various hyper parameters to see if the model performs better.
The Code follows the following order:
1. Loading the dataset
2. Statistical information retrieved from the dataset
3. Data visualizations
4. Data Pre processing. (Normalization, One hot encoding, handling missing/corrupted values and outliers)
5. Train test split
6. Building a Neural Network.


The tuning hyper parameters executed are as follows:
1. Modelling it with different activation functions
2. Changing the Drop out value
3. Modelling the optimizer
4. Adding early stopping
5. Adding regularizations
6. Defining a gradient clipping
7. Performing K-fold cross validation
